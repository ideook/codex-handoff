# Operations Guide

This document describes the normal operating model for `codex-handoff`.

It is intended for maintainers and users who want to understand how the product
behaves after installation, during upgrades, and while background sync is
running.

## Runtime Model

`codex-handoff` runs two background processes:

- `agent_service.js`
  orchestrates lifecycle, detects whether Codex is open, performs startup sync,
  and starts or stops the watcher
- `watch_service.js`
  watches Codex rollout files, routes changes to repos, and triggers repo-scoped
  sync work

The agent should only keep the watcher alive while the Codex app itself is
running.

## Primary Lifecycle Events

### Package install or upgrade

When the npm package is installed or upgraded:

1. `preinstall` stops any running background agent and watcher
2. package files are replaced
3. `postinstall` restarts the agent automatically if it had previously been
   running

This avoids replacing package files while older service processes are still
executing from the previous installation.

### Repo setup

`codex-handoff setup` is the repo-scoped reconciliation command. It:

- ensures the repo is attached to codex-handoff
- aligns local and remote repo state
- updates managed `AGENTS.md` metadata
- updates auto-start configuration when enabled
- starts or restarts the background agent when appropriate

### Cross-machine receive

`codex-handoff receive` is the pull-oriented entry point for another machine. It
aligns state from the remote repo prefix and restores the selected thread into
the local Codex workspace when possible.

### Repo uninstall

`codex-handoff uninstall` detaches a repo from codex-handoff management.

Current behavior:

- removes the repo mapping from local config
- removes the managed `AGENTS.md` block from the repo
- removes the `.codex-handoff/` `.gitignore` entry
- preserves the local `.codex-handoff/` directory by default
- stops the background agent and disables auto-start when no managed repos
  remain

## Watch And Sync Flow

While Codex is open:

1. the agent detects the main Codex app process
2. the watcher monitors `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`
3. rollout changes are mapped to repos using `session_meta.payload.cwd`
4. canonical user and assistant messages are extracted into the local
   thread publish cache under `.codex-handoff/local-threads/threads/`
5. local thread payloads are pushed to the configured remote prefix
6. the watcher continues while the Codex app process is alive, even if the app window is hidden
7. pulled remote thread state remains under `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/` as the default thread read cache
8. sync results are recorded in `.codex-handoff/sync-state.json`

When the Codex app/window is no longer detected, the agent performs one final
producer pass before stopping the watcher:

1. stop the watcher
2. stop without rewriting `.codex-handoff/local-threads/`
3. stop without attempting repo memory summarization

Consumer-side bootstrap reads stay inside `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/`.
The default read path starts with `current-thread.json`, uses
`thread-index.json` to locate additional context when needed, and reads only
the selected thread bundles under `threads/`.

## Important Files

### Local repo files

- `.codex-handoff/repo.json`
- `.codex-handoff/.env.local`
- `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/`
- `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/current-thread.json`
- `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/thread-index.json`
- `.codex-handoff/synced-threads/threads/`
- `.codex-handoff/local-threads/`
- `.codex-handoff/sync-state.json`
- optional/manual derived memory artifacts:
- `.codex-handoff/memory.md`
- `.codex-handoff/memory-state.json`

### Global runtime files

- `~/.codex-handoff/config.json`
- `~/.codex-handoff/runtime/agent-service.json`
- `~/.codex-handoff/runtime/watch-service.json`
- `~/.codex-handoff/runtime/watch-cursors.json`

### Global logs

- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/agent-service.log`
- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/watch-service.log`
- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/watch-events.log`
- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/watch-raw-events.log`
- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/watch-changed-files.log`
- `~/.codex-handoff/logs/watch-content.log`

## Health Checks

Useful commands:

```bash
codex-handoff doctor
codex-handoff agent status
codex-handoff sync status
codex-handoff remote whoami
codex-handoff remote validate
```

## Troubleshooting

### The watcher is running but nothing is syncing

Check:

- `codex-handoff agent status`
- `codex-handoff sync status`
- `watch-events.log`
- whether the repo is attached in `~/.codex-handoff/config.json`

### The agent was upgraded but behavior did not change

Run:

```bash
codex-handoff setup
```

This reconciles repo state on the new version and restarts the agent if needed.

### Codex window was closed but the watcher did not stop

The agent uses the main Codex app process for lifecycle detection. If the
watcher does not stop as expected, inspect:

- `agent-service.log`
- `agent-service.json`
- the current process list

### Package install and setup overlapped

The CLI uses a lifecycle lock to serialize `setup`, `receive`, and direct agent
restart operations. Package installation separately stops and restarts the
background services through npm lifecycle hooks.
