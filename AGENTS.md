# Codex Memory Bootstrap

Before doing substantive work in this repository:

1. Read `.codex-handoff/latest.md` first.
2. If the user asks to continue previous work, run `codex-handoff --repo . resume --goal "<user-goal>"`.
3. If the bootstrap summary is insufficient, inspect `.codex-handoff/handoff.json`.
4. Never load raw session jsonl files wholesale. Use `codex-handoff search`, `codex-handoff extract`, or `codex-handoff context-pack` to retrieve only relevant evidence.

Memory files are split by responsibility:

- `latest.md`: short current-state bootstrap summary
- `handoff.json`: structured restore state with goals, decisions, todos, files, and recent commands
- `raw/*.jsonl`: original evidence for audit and targeted retrieval

Preferred recovery flow:

1. Bootstrap from `latest.md`.
2. Restore structured state from `handoff.json`.
3. Search raw evidence only for the goal, files, or failures relevant to the current request.

Remote storage terminology:

- Use `remote` for the synchronized backend.
- The first supported remote provider is Cloudflare R2.
- Authenticate through `codex-handoff remote login r2`; do not assume certificate-based auth for R2.
